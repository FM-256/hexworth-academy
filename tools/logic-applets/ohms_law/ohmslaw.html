		<div>Ohm’s Law describes states that electrical voltage and electrical current are directly proportional.</div>
		<div>Ohm’s Law is the most fundamental law in electricity. The law describes the relationship between three of the most important electrical properties. These electrical principles are voltage, current and resistance.</div>
		<div>Short circuit damage</div>
		<div>Ohm’s Law also states that electrical resistance and electrical current are inversely proportional.</div>

		<div>–</div>
		<div>Current flow can be thought of as the movement of a cart. Voltage is the applied force to move the cart. As the force increases the cart movement increases.

If the force decreases the movement decreases. The force applied and the movement is directly proportional.

		<div>4/15</div>
		<div>On the other hand, Electrical resistance is like the weight and friction opposing the cart movement. If we increase the weight of the cart the movement will decrease. If we decrease the weight the movement will increase. These principles are inversely proportional.</div>

		<div>Voltage is what makes electric charges (electrons) move through an electrical circuit. Voltage is the push that causes charges to move in a wire or other electrical conductors. Voltage is also called electromotive force (EMF). Voltage is represented by a Capital letter “E” and is measured in Volts represented by a small “v”. The electric force is referred to as electrical potential. To create electron flow or electricity, you must have a difference in electrical potential within an electrical circuit. One way to produce voltage is to connect an electrical battery to the circuit.</div>
		<div>The unit to measure electron volume is the coulomb. One coulomb of electrical charge (6.24 x 1018 electrons). One ampere of current represents one coulomb of electrons moving past a specific point in one second.</div>
		<div>Current is represented by a Capital letter “I” and is measured in Amperes represented by a capital “A”. The letter I represents intensity, a term used early on. An ampere is a unit of measure of the rate of electron flow or current in an electrical conductor. When measuring flow of something like water, there must be a unit of volume past a specific point over a period of time.</div>
		<div>Electric Current</div>
		<div>The charge of an electron
e = 1.6 x 10-19 Coulomb
</div>
		<div>How many electrons are
needed to make 1 Coulomb?
6 x 1018
</div>
		<div>Voltage is the electrical force that would drive an electric current (electrons) between two points.

Current is the rate at which electric charge (electrons) flows past a point in a circuit.

		<div>Electrical resistance is the opposition that a substance offers to the flow of electric current. Resistance is caused by the attraction between electrons and protons in the atoms of the material used to carry electricity.

The electrical resistance of an object is a measure of its opposition to the flow of electric current. Resistance is represented by a capital letter “R” and is measured in Ohms represented by the Greek letter omega“Ω”.</div>

		<div>Resistance is weaker in electrical conductors like copper, silver or gold. Therefore, these materials are used to carry electrical current in most electrical circuits.</div>

		<div>The size of a material also impacts its electrical resistance. The resistance of a long copper wire is greater than the resistance of a short wire.</div>

		<div>E</div>
		<div>Ohm’s law describes the relationship between electrical current, voltage and resistance. Ohm’s law state that current is directly proportional to circuit voltage and inversely proposition to circuit resistance. This means that if the voltage connect to a circuit increases the current will increase at the same rate. The same is true is the voltage decreases, the current will decrease at the same rate.
