		<div>There are 22 SI derived units that have special names and symbols. SI derived units are measurement units that are derived from the base units. You create a derived unit by combining the base units using mathematical operations such as multiplication, division, or exponentiation. Derived units measure various physical quantities that are derived from fundamental properties or relationships.</div>

		<div>Imagine a bar magnet with its field lines spreading out in a particular pattern.
